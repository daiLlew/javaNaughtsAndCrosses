# javaNaughtsAndCrosses
I fancied a challenge so I thought I would have a go at writing a simple Noughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe if you are American) game.

Now in a playable state, improvements and update to follow. But if you can't wait run the following commands (in order) to
play the game:

  $ maven clean package
  $ java -jar target/tic-tac-toe-<VERSION>-SNAPSHOT.jar
